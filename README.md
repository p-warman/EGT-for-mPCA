Warman, P., Kaznatcheev, A., Araujo, A., Lynch, C., & Basanta, D. (2018). Fractionated follow-up chemotherapy delays the onset of resistance in bone metastatic prostate cancer. Games, 9(2), 19.

First published attempt at using evolutionary game theory to model the dynamics of prostate cancer metastasis to the bone. Allowed for the quick and rapid test of 2^10 therapies resulting in the finding of the potential beneifts of "fractionated therapies" over conventional chemotherapy.
